\title{Calculate recovery metrics from a time series with known disturbance date. The calcFrazier function derives the RRI, R80P and YrYr recovery indicators,
defined by Frazier et al. (2018). The indicators are originally developped for annual long-term time series of optical vegetation indices.
Yet, in order to be able to derive the indicators as well for dense and/or short time series, a modified version is suggested.
Here, the user can define the time period before, during and after the disturbance that is used to derive the indicators.
To reduce the interference of the seasonal pattern of dense time series, the chosen time period should cover blocks of n years.
